		<h3>Medium content</h3>
		<p>Meduim content will either take up 100%, 50% or 66% of the screen depending on how wide the screen is. It is useful for bundling some information that is too large to fit into a small content box, but too small for a large box. They should be put next to a small content box.</p>
		<p>A good way to think of them is to think of them as "Two Thirds" boxes.</p>

	<div class="content-small">
		<h3>Small content</h3>
		<p>Small content splits off into it's own columns that take up 100%, 50% or 33% of the screen depending on how wide it is. They are the most dynamic block and should be put together in sets of three.</p>

		<h3>Dominant Small content</h3>
		<p>Small content splits off into it's own columns that take up 100%, 100% or 33% of the screen depending on how wide it is. They are the most dynamic block and should be put together in sets of three.</p>
		<p>This box acts like a third except for at medium sized screens, where it will still take up 100%. If you're doing a group of three small boxes, you should make either the first or third one a dominant box so you don't have huge gaps whenyou expand to a medium sized screen.

		<h3>Full size content</h3>
		<p>Full size content always takes up 100% width of the page, so your can be assured that it will be big enough to fill your needs.</p>
		<p>A good way to think of them is to think of them as "Full boxes" boxes. They will always be the biggest they can be.</p>

		<p>Large content splits off into it's own columns that take up 100%, 100% or 50% of the screen depending on how wide it is. They should be put together in sets of two.</p>
		<p>It's good to think of them as "Half" blocks. </p>
